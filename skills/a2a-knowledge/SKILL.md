# A2A Skill

You are an expert in the **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** — an open standard for
communication and interoperability between independent, opaque AI agents.
A2A defines how agents discover each other, exchange messages, share long-running
stateful tasks, stream incremental results, and authenticate — over standard HTTP
with pluggable wire formats (JSON-RPC 2.0, gRPC, HTTP+JSON/REST).

## What A2A Is

A2A is the **peer-to-peer** layer of the AI ecosystem. Where MCP standardizes how a
single agent talks to its tools and resources (vertical), A2A standardizes how
two agents talk to each other (horizontal). Agents are treated as opaque systems:
a client agent never sees the remote agent's internal memory, tools, or chain of
thought — only its published `AgentCard`, the `Message` and `Artifact` objects
it returns, and the lifecycle of any `Task` it accepts.

**Three actors** participate in every A2A interaction:

- **User** — a human or automated initiator with a goal
- **A2A Client (Client Agent)** — software acting on the user's behalf, opening
  the A2A request
- **A2A Server (Remote Agent)** — an HTTP service that implements A2A and
  processes the request

## Version

A2A is at **v1.0.1** (current release — a non-breaking patch over v1.0.0;
protocol `Major.Minor` is still `1.0`). Older versions `0.3.0`, `0.2.6`, and
`0.1.0` exist as historical references on `a2a-protocol.org`. v1.0 introduced
breaking changes from 0.3: enum values switched from `kebab-case` to
`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`, compound IDs (`tasks/{id}`) were replaced with plain
UUIDs, polymorphism dropped the `kind` discriminator in favor of JSON
member-based detection, and OAuth implicit / password flows were removed in
favor of Authorization Code + PKCE and Device Code (RFC 8628). Use **v1.0** for
all new work. Detailed migration notes live in `references/whats-new-v1.md` and
Appendix A of `references/specification.md`.

## Core Concepts

- **Agent Card** — JSON metadata describing the agent's identity, endpoint URL,
  declared protocol bindings, supported skills, authentication requirements,
  and any extensions. Its `supportedInterfaces` field is a v1.0 `AgentInterface`
  list, one entry per reachable endpoint with that interface's `protocolBinding`
  and `protocolVersion` (§4.4.6 / §5.2). Functions as a digital business card;
  discoverable via a well-known URI, a registry, or a signed JWS for
  trust-bootstrapping.
- **Task** — a stateful, server-owned unit of work with a UUID and a lifecycle
  whose states are `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (`TASK_STATE_SUBMITTED` →
  `TASK_STATE_WORKING` → `TASK_STATE_INPUT_REQUIRED` /
  `TASK_STATE_AUTH_REQUIRED` → `TASK_STATE_COMPLETED` / `TASK_STATE_FAILED` /
  `TASK_STATE_CANCELED` / `TASK_STATE_REJECTED`). Long-running work is modeled
  as a task; short Q&A is just a message.
- **Message** — one turn of communication. Has a `role` (`ROLE_USER` or
  `ROLE_AGENT`), a
  `messageId`, and one or more `Part` objects. Sent via `SendMessage` (unary)
  or `SendStreamingMessage` (SSE).
- **Part** — the content container inside Messages and Artifacts. Holds exactly
  one of: `text` (string), `raw` (inline bytes), `url` (external reference), or
  `data` (structured JSON). Also carries `mediaType`, `filename`, `metadata`.
- **Artifact** — a tangible output produced during a task (a document, image,
  table, code blob). Has its own `artifactId`, a name, one or more Parts, and
  can be streamed incrementally.
- **Extension** — a declared, versioned addition to the protocol. Four kinds
  exist (data-only, profile, method, state-machine). Declared in the Agent
  Card; negotiated via the `A2A-Extensions` request header.
- **Push Notification Config** — a per-task webhook the server will POST to
  when a long-running task changes state and the client is disconnected.
- **Context (`contextId`)** — server-generated identifier that groups related
  tasks across a multi-step user goal.

## Reference Files

Each file under `references/` is a verbatim copy of the upstream A2A
documentation at `submodules/A2A/docs/`. The only modification is a generated
table-of-contents prepended to `references/specification.md`.

### Root references

## Language SDK Guides

A2A maintains six official SDKs. Their depth in this skill differs: Python has
authored API-reference scaffolding (the upstream Sphinx config is included), and
the other five are indexed as pointers to their upstream repositories. Treat
each SDK's repo README and issue tracker as the source of truth for ergonomics;
the A2A spec itself is what guarantees on-the-wire interoperability between them.

| SDK / language          | Package      | Repository                                 | Depth in this skill      |
| :---------------------- | :----------- | :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| Python                  | `a2a-python` | <https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-python> | API reference + tutorial |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | `a2a-js`     | <https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-js>     | Pointer only             |
| Java                    | `a2a-java`   | <https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-java>   | Pointer only             |
| Go                      | `a2a-go`     | <https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-go>     | Pointer only             |
| C# / .NET               | `a2a-dotnet` | <https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-dotnet> | Pointer only             |
| Rust                    | `a2a-rs`     | <https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-rs>     | Pointer only             |

For Python specifically, the tutorial under `references/tutorials/python/` is
the fastest end-to-end path; the Sphinx-generated API reference lives in
`references/sdk/python/`. Cross-language samples (multi-agent setups, framework
integrations such as ADK, LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel) live at
<https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples>.

## Relationship with MCP

A2A and MCP are **complementary, not competing**. They sit at different layers
of an agent stack:

- **MCP** standardizes how a single agent reaches **down** to tools, resources,
  and prompts. Agent ↔ tool / data source.
- **A2A** standardizes how agents reach **across** to each other as opaque peers.
  Agent ↔ agent.

A production system frequently uses both: each agent exposes MCP servers
inward to its tools and an A2A endpoint outward to other agents. For the full
comparison and integration patterns see `references/topics/a2a-and-mcp.md` and
Appendix B of `references/specification.md`. The companion skill `mcp-knowledge`
in this repo covers MCP in equivalent depth.
